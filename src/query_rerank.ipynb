      "Federal State, being part of governmental communities, houses two forms of states. These are \"federal state\" and \"federated states\". Federal state is also called \"federation\". Federation as a governmental system is accepted and implemented by many states all over the world. And federalism is a political system which emerged as a result of the organisation of federal state, and this system have a series of pecularities. In particular, when a mention is made of federalism, this calls to mind a sharing-out of govermental powers between federal state and federated states. And, on the other hand, in decentralization, some of the administrative and political powers are shared with the authorities which are not part of the central administrative organization. Decentralization involves two aspects, a political one and an administrative one. Both in federalism and decentralization, the governmental powers are shared between the central government and local govermental units. However, as there are significant and distinguishable differences between them, these systems are distinct from each other.\n",
